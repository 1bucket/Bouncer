# Bouncer
by me

## What is this?
This is a small project that simulates bouncing balls in the space of the program's window. The balls do not collide with each other -- they only collide with the bounds of the window.</p>
You can hold down any mouse button to force the balls to gravitate to your cursor, or click any mouse button to 
throw the balls in a random direction.</p>
If you'd like to run this for yourself, there are constants in the Settings file that you can change to manipulate the number of balls, friction force, and bounciness of the window bounds.</p></br>
Thanks for reading!
